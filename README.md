double-local-thresh-segmentation
================================

This is the source code of double local thresholding algorithmfor trawl-based underwater camera systems. The algorithm is implemented in C++ using OpenCV 2.4.8 (x64) library. All runtime arguments are taken via the command-line interface.

For details of the algorithm, or if you use the source code in your work for publications, please refer to and cite the following papers:
