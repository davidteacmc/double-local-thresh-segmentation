double-local-thresh-segmentation
================================

This is the source code of double local thresholding algorithmfor trawl-based underwater camera systems. The algorithm is implemented in C++ using OpenCV 2.4.8 (x64) library. All runtime arguments are taken via the command-line interface.

For details of the algorithm, please refer to the following paper:

M.-C. Chuang, J.-N. Hwang, K. Williams and R. Towler, "Automatic fish segmentation via double local thresholding for trawl-based underwater camera systems," IEEE Intl. Conf. on Image Processing (ICIP), 2011.
